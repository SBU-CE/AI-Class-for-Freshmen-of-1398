# A journey to learn Artificial Intelligence 

This repository contains the codes we wrote on a class we held for teaching basics of Artificial Intelligence and mostly classic algorithms in this field. Hopefully, we'll get to Machine Learning and Deep Learning later.

All you need to know is Python! If you don't, check out the first session, it may help. 

## Install python requirements

Each session has its own requirements and libraries. Requirements are available in each session. In otder to install them, run this command on each folder:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The name of the file may vary but the idea's the same.
